Typical request flow:

User action (frontend)
→ hits a route (routes/post.py or some trending route)

Route calls a service function:

sentiment_service.analyze_post(...)
trending_service.get_trending_posts(...)

Service talks to:

database models (Post, Vote, Sentiment)
maybe ML models

Service returns processed data to route

Route uses schemas to format response

Response sent back to frontend → shown on UI

# flow -
🔻 FRONTEND (request)
        ↓
🔻 ROUTE (decides what operation to run, which part of backend responds to that request)
        ↓
🔻 SCHEMA (validates & cleans input)
        ↓
🔻 SERVICE (business logic / ML / trending logic)
        ↓
🔻 DATABASE (read/write/update)
        ↓
🔻 SERVICE (returns processed result)
        ↓
🔻 SCHEMA (formats safe response => hides sensitive data)
        ↓
🔻 ROUTE (sends final response)
        ↓
🔻 FRONTEND (display to user)
